# Database_Project
A project involving databases and SQL for CS370 (Database Management Systems).

This repository contains files including: 
Project Deliverables: 
- SOW
- LDM (JPEG of ERWIN or other data modeling software / hand drawn)
- DDL for creating tables (SQL Script) // Parent tables first 
- DDL for dropping tables (SQL Script) // Child tables first 
- Data 
- Read me with steps and instructions for creating database and loading data 
- Queries (4-8 queries in a SQL script file) 

To create the tables and load the data involved in this database, run the SQL script Create_Tables.sql. (We copied and pasted text into phpMyAdmin to proceed.) 
The Create_Tables.sql will not only create the tables for our data set but also load the data via SQL insert statements. 
  As a backup, within the Data folder, there is a dedicated InsertData.sql script file as well. 
Next, either run all 10 of our queries at once by running the Query.sql script, or individually copy and paste queries from the Queries.pdf file. 
Once finished, run/copy and paste the Drop_Tables.sql file to clear all tables and data from our project. 

Thank you and happy retirement! 
Have fun on that beach making boogie woogie piano music.
